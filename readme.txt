This is a small example on how to use TomEE in conjunction with Maven and HSQLDB.

This example is as barebones as it can get without sacrificing functionality, 
so do not expect any nifty layouts or nifty functionality. 
I wanted to provide a real world hello world with JAAS authentication and a secured area.
You can use this program as starting point for your own programs.

You can start the program simply by running mvn install tomee:run
and then point your browser to: http://localhost:8080/tomeemaven/
